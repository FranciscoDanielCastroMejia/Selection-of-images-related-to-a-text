This embargo provoked an energy crisis that quadrupled the price of oil in a few months. In response to the energy crisis, the governments of countries such as the United States, Germany, France and Japan sought to mitigate their dependence on oil.",

In spite of the environmental problems, it is anticipated that the use of fossil fuels will increase in the medium term. Mitigating the environmental effects of fossil coal burning, including carbon sequestration technologies, will then play a key role.",

Until 1986, they all required very low temperatures to act as such. Superconductors promise a large number of applications, some of which are already a reality. These materials are used for the generation of high-intensity magnetic fields in medical diagnostic systems by magnetic resonance.",

With the exception of nuclear energy, the remaining carbon-free energies are renewable. Three of the most potential renewable energies present and future are hydroelectric, wind and solar. All renewable energy generation technologies available at this time have advantages and disadvantages and no one will give us a magic solution to replacing fossil fuels in the immediate future.",

The use of water from the Amu Dari\u00e1 and Sir Dari\u00e1n rivers for agricultural purposes was, however, so massive that the sea level of the Soviet era was so high. The water of the ArAl Sea was also severely contaminated by the pesticides used in the agricultural fields.",
